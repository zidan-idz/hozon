    "I was walking down the block",
    "Headphones on, lost in my thoughts",
    "Then I saw you out of the blue",
    "And suddenly, I didn't know what to do \n",

    "I tried to act all chill",
    "Like I wasn't caught in a trance",
    "But I'm pretty sure I looked ridiculous",
    "When I tried to act cool and then just danced \n",

    "Oh no, I like you, now it's clear",
    "I didn't mean to",
    "But here you are, so near",
    "You smiled at me",
    "And I almost froze",
    "Why does this happen every time I'm close? \n",

    "I pretended not to care",
    "But I could feel you in the air",
    "You waved and said 'hey'",
    "And I think I may have turned five shades of red today \n",

    "I swear I'm fine, I've got this liked",
    "But then you joked and I just walked",
    "Now I'm laughing like I've lost my mind",
    "Wishing I could rewind and not be so blind \n",

    "Oh no, I like you, now it's clear",
    "I didn't mean to",
    "But here you are, so near",
    "You smiled at me",
    "And I almost froze",
    "Why does this happen every time I'm close? \n",

    "Now I'm replaying every word we spoke",
    "Did I mess it up, or was it just a joke?",
    "I'll pretend I'm okay",
    "But I'll probably overthink it all day \n",

    "Oh no, I like you, now it's clear",
    "I didn't mean to",
    "But here you are, so near",
    "You smiled at me",
    "And I almost froze",
    "Why does this happen every time I'm close? \n",

    "Oh no, I like you, it's plain to see",
    "I've got a little crush",
    "And it's getting to me",
    "But for now, I'll just smile and sigh",
    "And hope you'll notice me",
    "Walking by \n",

    "Walking by \n",

Oh No I Like You  
By: Auric Veil

I was walking down the block  
Headphones on, lost in my thoughts  
Then I saw you out of the blue  
And suddenly, I didn't know what to do  

I tried to act all chill  
Like I wasn't caught in a trance  
But I'm pretty sure I looked ridiculous  
When I tried to act cool and then just danced  

Oh no, I like you, now it's clear  
I didn't mean to  
But here you are, so near  
You smiled at me  
And I almost froze  
Why does this happen every time I'm close?  

I pretended not to care  
But I could feel you in the air  
You waved and said "hey"  
And I think I may have turned five shades of red today  

I swear I'm fine, I've got this liked  
But then you joked and I just walked  
Now I'm laughing like I've lost my mind  
Wishing I could rewind and not be so blind  

Oh no, I like you, now it's clear  
I didn't mean to  
But here you are, so near  
You smiled at me  
And I almost froze  
Why does this happen every time I'm close?  

Now I'm replaying every word we spoke  
Did I mess it up, or was it just a joke?  
I'll pretend I'm okay  
But I'll probably overthink it all day  

Oh no, I like you, now it's clear  
I didn't mean to  
But here you are, so near  
You smiled at me  
And I almost froze  
Why does this happen every time I'm close?  

Oh no, I like you, it's plain to see  
I've got a little crush  
And it's getting to me  
But for now, I'll just smile and sigh  
And hope you'll notice me  
Walking by  

Walking by  

Oh no, I like you  
It's plain to see  
I've got a little crush  
And it's getting to me
